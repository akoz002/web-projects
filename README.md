# web-projects

Hi, my name is Alex Kozlov (akoz002) and this repo contains my web development projects. **Frontend** projects are implemented with *HTML, CSS/SASS, JavaScript, React/Redux, D3*, and are built with *Parcel*. **Backend** projects are implemented with *Node.js, Express* and *Mongoose/MongoDB*.

## Frontend Projects

You can view my frontend portfolio page at the link below (the source can be found at `portfolio/src`):

* https://akoz002.github.io/web-projects/portfolio/dist/

Or you can view the individual projects in the sections below.

### React Projects

Projects implemented with *React* or *React/Redux*. The source for each project can be found under `react-projects/<project>/src`. The apps were built with *Parcel* and can be viewed at the links below. Source maps were generated and the original source can be viewed in browser developer tools.

## Backend Projects

Projects implemented in Node.js and Express. The "url shortener" and "exercise tracker" projects also use Mongoose/MongoDB. At the frontend these projects also contain React components for posting and getting data from the backend. For further information and links to demo apps, please see the individual project repos.
