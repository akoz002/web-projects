# web-projects

Hi, my name is Alex Kozlov (akoz002) and this repo contains my web development projects. **Frontend** projects are implemented with *HTML, CSS/SASS, JavaScript, React/Redux, D3*, and are built with *Parcel*. **Backend/Fullstack** projects are implemented with *Node.js, Express, Mongoose/MongoDB* and contain *React* components at the frontend.

## Backend/Fullstack Projects

At the backend these projects are implemented in *Node.js* and *Express*; the first two projects also use *Mongoose/MongoDB*. At the frontend these projects contain *React* or *React/Redux* components for posting and getting data from the backend. In each project repo the server source can be found in `server.js` and React source can be found in `views/src/`. The frontend components were built with *Parcel*. Source maps were generated and the original source can be viewed in browser developer tools (`Ctrl + Shift + I`, then select the "Source/Debugger" tab). For further information and links to demo apps, please see the individual project repos below. Please note that these apps are hosted on Heroku and hibernate while inactive; they may take a few seconds to start up when first opened.

### React Projects
